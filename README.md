### Project Description:

Smart Assistant Hub is an integrated platform for personal information and task management. It includes modules for notes, knowledge base, task management and AI integration for advanced assistance features.

#### Microservices Components:

1. **Notes Microservice**: Notes management and storage. CRUD operations implementation.
2. **Knowledge Base Microservice**: Organization and storage of structured data (e.g., articles, manuals).
3. **To-Do List Microservice**: Manage tasks, reminders, and calendar.
4. **Personal Assistant microservice**: Integration with artificial intelligence APIs (e.g. ChatGPT) to provide automated responses and assistance.
5. **Authentication and Security Microservice**: Access control and data security.

### Technologies:

- **ASP.NET Core 8** for building microservices.
- **Docker** for containerization and simplified deployment.
- **Entity Framework Core** for interacting with databases.
- **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka** for handling messages and events between microservices.
- **SignalR** for real-time implementations (e.g., notifications).
- **OpenAI API** for artificial intelligence integration.

### Functionality and features:

- **Note interface**: Create, edit, delete and search for notes.
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Categorize and search the database.
- **To-Do List Integration**: Scheduler, reminders, notifications.
- **AI Integration**: Using AI to automatically generate responses, analyze text, and help manage tasks.
- **Security and Scalability**: Secure data storage, application scalability through microservices architecture.

### Potential Extensions:

- **Mobile application** for on-the-go access.
- **Integration with external services** (e.g. Google calendars, Microsoft calendars).
